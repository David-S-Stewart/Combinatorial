Abstract
--------

PEP_8_ provides standard Python coding style guidelines that are fully adhered
to in this project.

pycodestyle_ is a community supported style checker for PEP8 and is use on all
commits.

My personal preference on line length for larger projects is a 100 character
maximum as this more naturally handles the inevitable long names in those
contexts. For smaller stand-alone components, 80 characters is sufficient and
is adhered to.
