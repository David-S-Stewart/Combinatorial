Abstract
--------

The minimum length is the minimum number of combinations needed to cover all
required sub-combinations. There are several factors that feed into this
calculation.

Absolute Minimum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For unconstrained combinatorials, the absolute minimum length of the iteration
is calculated as the product of the largest n dimensions where n is the
coverage required. This minimum cannot always be met.
